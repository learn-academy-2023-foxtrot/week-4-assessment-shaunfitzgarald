# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object-oriented programming is essentially based off of Plato's Form Theory. We imagine the most ideal form for something and use that lense to interpret the world. OOP is supposed to be more geared towards humans, and taking in Plato's theory, I believe OOP is essentially coding with objects in mind first, like how humans recognize/see the world in objets, and then building and epanding further and further down the chain of objects and subclasses, intil you have everything included everything.

Researched answer: Everything is an object essentially in Ruby. Objects are where data and behavior become intertwined.The behavior is the function and the data is the information held by variables. This means that data and behavior are "encapsulated" within objects. Objects are instances of classes,  a concrete realization of that class's blueprint or template, and can represent real-world entities or concepts in a program.

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: It means that the return is implied and you do not have to put return to get a return.

Researched answer: In Ruby, the term "implicit return" refers to the automatic return of the last evaluated expression in a method or block. Unlike some other programming languages where you explicitly use the return keyword to return a value from a function or method, Ruby allows you to omit the return keyword in most cases, and the value of the last evaluated expression will be automatically returned.

3. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A block in ruby sits between a def and its end.

Researched answer: In Ruby, a block is a way to package and encapsulate a piece of code that can be passed around as an object and executed later. Blocks are often used in conjunction with methods to provide flexible and reusable functionality. They are denoted by {} or do...end keywords and can accept parameters.

4. How do you extract a single value from a Ruby hash?

Your answer: You reference the key.

Researched answer: To extract a single value from a Ruby hash, you can use the square bracket notation [] along with the key of the value you want to extract.

5. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Your answer: A version manager manages what version of software you are using. So, RVM (Ruby Version Manager) manages what version of Ruby you are using.

Researched answer: A version manager is a tool or software utility that helps you manage multiple versions of a programming language, runtime environment, or software package on your computer. It allows you to easily switch between different versions of these components, depending on the requirements of your projects or applications. Version managers are particularly useful in development environments where you might need to work with various versions of a language or package simultaneously.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Test-driven development: Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology or practice that emphasizes writing tests for code before writing the actual code itself.

2. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL, often referred to simply as "Postgres," is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is known for its reliability, extensibility, and robust feature set, making it a popular choice for a wide range of applications, from small projects to large enterprise systems.

3. CRUD: CRUD is an acronym that stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It represents the four basic operations or functions that are commonly associated with persistent storage and the management of data in a database or data management system. These operations are fundamental to most software applications that interact with data, including web applications, mobile apps, desktop software, and more.
