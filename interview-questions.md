1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object-oriented programming is essentially based off of Plato's Form Theory. We imagine the most ideal form for something and use that lense to interpret the world. OOP is supposed to be more geared towards humans, and taking in Plato's theory, I believe OOP is essentially coding with objects in mind first, like how humans recognize/see the world in objets, and then building and epanding further and further down the chain of objects and subclasses, intil you have everything included everything.

Researched answer: Everything is an object essentially in Ruby. Objects are where data and behavior become intertwined.The behavior is the function and the data is the information held by variables. This means that data and behavior are "encapsulated" within objects. Objects are instances of classes,  a concrete realization of that class's blueprint or template, and can represent real-world entities or concepts in a program.

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: It means that the return is implied and you do not have to put return to get a return.
